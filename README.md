# notetaker
An extremely lightweight and simple notetaking app.
<br> <br>

Notetaker is a brand new, lightweight app that is built on C# with the help of WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation). This is my first attempt at making an app, so don't expect amazing features. However, it's always nice to have a minimal-featured note taking app for people that need simple notetaking in a blink of an eye. <br>

I really appreciate anybody who actually downloads it, as a starter, any download means a lot to me. Thank you!
